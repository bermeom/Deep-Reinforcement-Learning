# Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Background

   Reinforcement learning is learning what to do to map situations to actions in an environment as to maximize a reward.  
   The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trial and error.  
   A reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP): At each time *t*, the agent receives an observation *o(t)*, and a reward *r(t)*. It then chooses an action a *a(t)*, which is sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state *s(t+1)*. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to collect as much reward as possible.
